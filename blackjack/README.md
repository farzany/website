# JS/CSS Blackjack

I created this game while learning the Javascript language. It allowed me to tinker with the language while also giving me some design experience with CSS. The game follows basic Blackjack rules - dealer deals until 16 (inclusive), and therefore stands on 17 and higher.

**I hope you find my little game amusing :)**
