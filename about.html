            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a second year student at McMaster University studying Software Engineering. I am currently passionate about discovering and automating time-consuming, repetitive tasks. For more information about my academic career, please visit my <a href="#" class="in-text">LinkedIn profile</a>.<br><br>Aside from programming, I of course have many hobbies and interests! With nearly 3000 hours on CSGO alone, I think I qualify as a GamerÂ©. I even took a crack at becoming a Minecraft YouTuber back in Highschool, which must add a few (imaginary) points to my Gamer-ness. I also love photography - taking shots of sceneries, people, food, plants, buildings, and anything else I stumble upon! I post the highlights on my photography <a href="#" class="in-text">Instagram page</a>. Another great hobby of mine is biking, which helps me stay in shape, relax, and find cool stuff to take photographs of. I currently ride a Marlin Trek 5. Along with my love for biking, I'm also passionate about bodybuilding! I definitely have a 7'4", 250lb of pure-muscle physique with 35" diameter biceps. No pictures, you just gotta trust me. As one does, I also have a passion for memes - so much so that I started my own <a href="#" class="in-text">Instagram meme page</a> a while back.<br><br> Since the start of that YouTube Minecraft career I mentioned, I've spent countless days learning Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, After Effects, LucidPress, and other editing softwares. Along the way, I've learnt a lot about design and how to make good-looking posters, ads, brochures, websites, thumbnails, etc. These skills along with my programming skills have enabled me to do so much online - to the point where I've done many commisions for real businesses. These commisions include marketing material, website design and setup, business cards, programs that organize tonnes of data, and much more. I realized others may benefit from my learnings so I started a programming <a href="#" class="in-text">YouTube channel</a>, as well! Lastly, as any good Cryptocurrency connoisseur would, I must breifly mention that I do Crypto without mentioning how much money I've lost (a lot). However, I will mention that it's been very exciting and fun trading with friends :)</p>
