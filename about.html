                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year student at McMaster studying software engineering. I am currently passionate about discovering and automating time-consuming, repetitive tasks.

                        <h2>Gaming</h2>
                        <p>Ever since I can remember, I've had a wonderful relationship with video games. I started out playing every stock Windows game on an old PC with 2mb of ram, worked my way up to Sonic on the SEGA, and once I reached Stronghold Crusader, I was hooked. I really enjoy sandbox games like Minecraft that allow me to express my creativity. I find puzzle games refreshing and helpful in breaking free of my functional fixedness. I find the social aspect of team games extremely intriuging - connecting and playing with people from across the world, allowing me to Rush B Site with a man from Russia, try to decode what a Spanish team member is trying to tell me, or even practice my Mandarine with the Chinese clan I got paired with.</p>

                        <h2>Crypto</h2>
                        <p>Ever since the early days of highschool, I've been drawn in by the thrill of the Cryptocurrency world. There was never a dull day when my friends and I were trading some new promising coin - with our "net worths" changing by the second. Reaching a cumulative balance of $50,000 just for it to crash down to $1000 the next month. Immune to feelings of regret and loss after that, we're excited to research and trade together - hoping for profit but the experience of doing it together is profit itself.

                        <h2>Photography</h2>
                        <p>I'm not sure when my interest in photography began, however, I know that it peeked in highschool. I've always found myself in scenes and locations that yearn to be photographed, and once I purchased a decent camera, I did just that. Everywhere I go, I'll stop to take one or two photos, implementing the skills and guidelines my highschool photography course taught me. I currently display my favorite photographs that I have taken on an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/farzan.photography/" class="general" target="__blank">Instagram page</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Memes</h2>
                        <p>I mean, who doesn't like memes? Short pieces of content that make your day exceptionally better. For that reason, I set out to become a concierge of memes - stockpiling and posting memes to an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/memeshlut/" class="general" target="__blank">Instagram page</a>, just to make people smile. A fun little hobby of mine that I try to keep up with daily.</p>

                        <h2>Video/Photo Editing</h2>
                        <p>Near the start of highschool, I began working with Photoshop and Sony Vegas Pro in order to create gaming videos for Youtube. I found an interest in the softwares and began working with them outside of my "Youtube career". I have become fairly proficient in Photoshop; regularly using it to create logos, posters, and cards for many personal projects (and even a Real Estate client!). I very frequently use it to create graphics for school assignments, as well. I moved past Sony Vegas and onto Adobe Premiere which I still use regularly - editing infrequent Youtube videos, videos for school projects, and usually videos just for fun! Aside from a gaming channel, I also started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvrcJLLb73nSfFRurmGUQuQ" class="general" target="__blank">YouTube channel</a> for sharing my programming and academic experiences with the world!</p>
